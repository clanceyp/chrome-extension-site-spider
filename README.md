# AEM URL Blender


This extension adds a page action menu to switch URLs for Adobe AEM and other large projects.
AEM URL Blender extension adds links to the page action menu. 
It uses simple regular expressions to enable you to match paths and replace sections of the URL. 
This extension was developed primarily for use when you are working on a large project with many instances. For smaller projects I recommend jmhobbs's Domain Swap extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domain-swap/ngiiihlebepigjbefembddhdplmaghep
