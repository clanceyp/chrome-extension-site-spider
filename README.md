# Site Spider - content finder


This extension incorporates a page action menu that initiates a search for pages within the current domain, matching specific search strings. The search scrutinizes the HTML rather than the text content of the page, making it particularly useful when seeking an element with a distinct class name or a page featuring specific meta-data.
